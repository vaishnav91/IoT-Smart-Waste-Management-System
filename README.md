# Enhanced Waste Collection using IoT Technology: A Smart Waste Collection System for Efficient Campus Operations

This project proposes a smart and sustainable solution to address pollution caused by solid waste on college campuses. By integrating Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the system enhances the efficiency of waste collection processes, promoting a cleaner and safer campus environment.

A custom-designed IoT device is mounted inside waste bins to monitor real-time fill levels. Once a bin crosses a predefined threshold, the system automatically triggers SMS alerts to the designated waste collection personnel, enabling timely and optimized garbage collection.

To further ensure safety, the device is equipped with IR flame sensors and MQ-6 gas sensor to detect potential fire hazards and the leakage of harmful gases from accumulated waste. This feature adds a critical layer of hazard prevention and response.

The real-time data collected is vital for data-driven decision-making in campus waste management. It aids in identifying high-traffic areas requiring additional bins and allocating waste management resources more effectively.

Ultimately, this system minimizes the environmental footprint of solid waste, ensures a hygienic and secure campus, and supports the overall well-being of students and facultyâ€”making it a crucial component of an effective educational infrastructure.

The device integrates a suite of sensors and communication modules, including: 
  1.Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04 
  2.ESP 8266 NodeMCU  
  3.Arduino UNO Microcontroller 
  4.SIM900A GSM Module  
  5.IR Flame Sensor 
  6.MQ-6 Gas Sensor  
  7.9V Battery 
  8.16X2 LCD Module
